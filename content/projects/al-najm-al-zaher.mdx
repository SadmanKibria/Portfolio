Al Najm Al Zaher is a modern, responsive commodity trading platform I developed
for a client in the commodities sector. This project demonstrates my ability to
deliver professional, business-focused web solutions that meet specific client
requirements while implementing best practices in full-stack development.

The client needed a platform to showcase their commodity trading services,
focusing on agricultural products with detailed product information, company
profiles and contact functionality. I translated these business requirements
into a fully functional, SEO-optimised website with a clean, professional
design.
