At ByteBridge Solutions, a small digital agency, I joined as a web development
intern and worked across both marketing websites and client web apps. I
supported front-end development using JavaScript and React, assisted with
WordPress and PHP-based sites and gained practical experience working with REST
APIs, version control and common development tools.

This internship exposed me to real-world project workflows, multi-stakeholder
collaboration and iterative feature development, all while building a strong
foundation in responsive design, code quality and teamwork.

  Assisted in building components for an internal dashboard using React,
  focusing on layout structure, reusable components and responsive styling with

  Helped maintain and customise client websites built on WordPress. Added custom
  styling, created new page templates and adjusted PHP files to meet client
  requests.

  input, handled async submission and displayed user feedback.

  cross-browser compatibility and better mobile responsiveness.
