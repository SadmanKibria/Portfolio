I first worked with Autolak Yellow Garage as a volunteer to improve their
digital presence and help with basic IT support. I built and deployed a complete
website for their auto repair business using WordPress.

In 2025, I revisited this project and rebuilt it entirely using **Next.js** and
**Tailwind CSS** as a **portfolio-focused upgrade**. The rebuild reflects my
growth as a full-stack developer, showcasing component-driven architecture,
responsive UI and better developer ergonomics.

# Key Projects and Contributions

- **Original WordPress Website**:  
  Designed and deployed a business website with service listings, CTAs, Google
  Maps and SEO optimisation. Collaborated directly with the garage owner Mr. Ken
  to understand business needs and deliver an easy-to-manage site.

- **Next.js Rebuild (2025)**:  
  Rebuilt the entire project from scratch using Next.js 14 App Router, Tailwind
  CSS and modern tooling. Refactored the structure for better maintainability,
  accessibility and performance.

- **SEO and UX Improvements**:  
  Implemented best practices in meta tagging, semantic HTML, responsive design
  and Core Web Vitals performance tuning.

- **Client Communication & Handoff**:  
  Delivered basic training and documentation during the original build to help
  the client maintain the site post-launch.
