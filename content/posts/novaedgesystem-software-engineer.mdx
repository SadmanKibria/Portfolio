As a Junior Software Engineer at NovaEdge Systems, I worked on internal tools
and client-facing platforms supporting the logistics and fleet management
industry. My role focused on backend services and API development using
**Node.js**, **Express** and **MongoDB**, with occasional frontend contributions
using **React**.

I worked closely with senior developers, QA engineers and product managers in
agile sprints to deliver tested and maintainable features that served real
business needs.

# Key Projects and Contributions

- **Fleet Tracking API Development**  
  Developed and maintained RESTful APIs to manage vehicle data, driver logs and
  geolocation tracking. Wrote endpoints, handled request validation and
  implemented authentication using JWT.

- **Database Design and Query Optimisation**  
  Created and updated MongoDB schemas, indexes and aggregation pipelines to
  support real-time data reporting and filtering. Improved query performance by
  25% through index tuning.

- **Admin Dashboard Support (React)**  
  Built reusable components and integrated data from APIs into the internal
  admin dashboard, allowing staff to manage logistics, users and asset statuses
  in real time.

- **Automated Testing & Code Reviews**  
  Wrote unit and integration tests with Jest and Supertest. Participated in team
  code reviews and applied feedback to improve code structure and readability.

- **Documentation and Developer Handoff**  
  Created internal documentation for key APIs and modules to support onboarding
  and reduce ramp-up time for new developers.

# Notes

- All work was performed in a remote-first agile team with daily standups,
  sprint planning and code reviews
- APIs and tools contributed to are internal/private, but technical walkthroughs
  or rebuilds can be shared during interviews
- This role served as the critical bridge between my early learning and becoming
  a self-directed full-stack developer
