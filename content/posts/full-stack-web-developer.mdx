I have independently designed, developed and deployed production-grade websites
and web applications for businesses across E-commerce, charity, trading,
automotive services, hospitality, home improvements and local trades.

I have led **end-to-end project lifecycles** from client requirements gathering
and system architecture to full-stack development, SEO optimisation, deployment
pipelines and long-term maintenance.

Specialising in **Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma ORM,
Stripe integration** and performance engineering, I deliver scalable, fast and
SEO-optimised solutions aligned with modern development best practices.
